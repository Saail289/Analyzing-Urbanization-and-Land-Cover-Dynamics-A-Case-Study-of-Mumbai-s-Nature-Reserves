# Analyzing Urbanization and Land Cover Dynamics: A Case Study of Mumbai’s Nature Reserves



### Project Overview

This project analyzes the spatio-temporal dynamics of urbanization and land-use changes in Mumbai’s nature reserves from 1991 to 2023. Leveraging geospatial tools and datasets, the study highlights patterns of urban growth, green space reduction, and ecological fragmentation, aiming to provide insights into sustainable urban development and nature conservation.

### Problem Statement

Urbanization poses significant threats to natural ecosystems, especially in metropolitan areas like Mumbai. Despite the availability of GIS data, systematic analysis of land cover changes over time remains limited. This project bridges that gap by examining the socio-economic and environmental impacts of urban growth on Mumbai’s natural reserves.

### Key Objectives

1. Analyze spatio-temporal patterns of urban growth and land-use changes.

2. Create thematic maps and visualizations for urbanization trends.

3. Quantify green space reduction and urban density metrics.

4. Evaluate the socio-economic and environmental implications of urbanization.

### Tools and Technologies

1. QGIS: For geospatial data processing and thematic map creation.

2. Python Libraries:

    i. GeoPandas: Geospatial data handling and analysis.

    ii. Rasterio: Raster data processing.

    iii. Folium: Interactive web map generation.

    iv. Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.

    v. Pandas: Data wrangling and tabular data analysis.

    vi. NumPy & Scikit-learn: Data preprocessing and clustering.

    vii. OpenStreetMap (OSM): For vector data like building footprints and roads.

3. Google Earth Engine (GEE): For web app development and dynamic land cover visualization.

### Methodology

1. Data Collection: Obtained land cover datasets for 1991, 1995, 2010, 2020, and 2023 from sources like USGS EarthExplorer.

2. Data Preprocessing: Processed datasets using QGIS and Python for thematic map creation.

3. Visualization: Developed maps and heatmaps to depict urban sprawl, green space reduction, and land-use transitions.

4. Analysis: Quantified urbanization trends and evaluated environmental impacts.

5. Web App: Built an interactive tool using GEE for year-wise land cover comparison.

### Key Findings 

1. Urban Growth:

    i. Significant expansion of urban areas from 1991 to 2023, particularly in central and northern Mumbai.

    ii. Urban densification intensified post-2020.

2. Green Space Reduction:

    i. Continuous fragmentation and reduction of natural reserves, especially in northern regions.

    ii. By 2023, green spaces were isolated and surrounded by urban development.

3. Environmental Impacts:

    i. Ecological corridors disrupted, affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services.

    ii. Pressure on protected areas like Sanjay Gandhi National Park.

### Urbanization Metrics

1. 1991–1995: Initial urban expansion.

2. 1995–2010: Rapid urban growth driven by population and infrastructure development.

3. 2010–2020: Accelerated urbanization and green space fragmentation.

4. 2020–2023: Slower urban growth but intensified densification.

### Web App

An interactive web application was developed using Google Earth Engine, allowing users to visualize temporal changes in land cover across selected.
